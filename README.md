### Code Structure
We decided to use an ArrayList for our critter collection. This was a static variable in the Critter class.
We also created our separate Critter classes (four total as specified). We have not yet decided fully
the implementation details of the critters. They will contain the `doTimeStep()`, `fight()`, and `toString()` functions
as well as any extra functions that would make sense for the specified critter.
We chose to follow the given structure in the jar file without adding any new classes besides our critters.
